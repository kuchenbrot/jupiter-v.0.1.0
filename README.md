# jupiter-v.0.2.0
This is an AI that is supposed to say you if your text is formal or not. It's written in Python 3 and has some german examples (because I'm german yk) in the text.json file. This file contains the text which the AI. You can do what you want with the text.json file to make the AI better. The TXT-file isn't important but necessary.

Note: 
It isn't fully done yet. It's still not that efficient I will work on it in the future. But this is the 1. version so please forgive me.
